## Work Log
**Date** // time spent + work done

**2/28/2016**

* Kyle, 10 hr - finished application, javadocs, debugging

* Reid, 7 hr - worked on javadocing, delete from where, join, update, and fixed some minor bugs

* Jessica, 3 hr - new diagrams, wrote report.

**2/27/2016**

* Kyle, 11 hr - working on application

* Reid, 6 hr - working on small fixes in parser, attempting junit

* Jessica, 2 hr - proofreading final mostly

* Rishabh, 2.5 hr - worked on final report

**2/26/2016**

* Kyle, 3 hr - planning and setting up skeleton code for application

* Jessica, 7 hr - more fixing up parser. parser is complete minus multiple conditions (ex. condition || condition). engine needs update and delete functions that handle conditions. framework is laid out for delete in engine, but not completely implemented.

**2/25/2016**

* Reid, 4 hr - fixed rename, made write and open do .db, created new constructors, mostly working on boolean logic

* Jessica, 3 hr - fixing up parser; it's almost complete

* All, during lab (1 hr) - planning

**2/23/2016**

* All, during lab (1 hr) - planning

  * If possible, Jessica fix parser. Kyle set up framework for and write application. Reid help write application. Rishabh write report and help with application after.

  * Otherwise, Jessica and Reid fix parser. Kyle set up framework for and write application. Reid help write application. Rishabh write report and help with application after.
